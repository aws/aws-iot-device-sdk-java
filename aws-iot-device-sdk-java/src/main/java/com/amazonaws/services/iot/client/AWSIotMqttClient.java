/**
 * This class is the main interface of the AWS IoT Java library. It provides
 * both blocking and non-blocking methods for interacting with AWS IoT services
 * over the MQTT protocol. With this client, one can directly publish messages
 * to the AWS IoT service and subscribe or unsubscribe to any pub/sub topics.
 * When using this class in conjunction with {@link AWSIotDevice}, one can
 * easily access AWS IoT device shadows in the cloud, and keep them in sync with
 * the real devices.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of connections this SDK supports to connect to the AWS
 * IoT service:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>MQTT (over TLS 1.2) with X.509 certificate based mutual authentication</li>
 * <li>MQTT over Secure WebSocket with AWS SigV4 authentication</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For MQTT over TLS, a {@link KeyStore} containing a valid device certificate
 * and private key is required for instantiating the client. Password for
 * decrypting the private key in the KeyStore must also be provided.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For MQTT over WebSocket, AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) protocol is used for
 * device authentication. For that, a valid AWS IAM access Id and access key
 * pair is required for instantiating the client.
 * <p>
 * In both cases, AWS IoT IAM policies must be configured properly before the
 * connection can be established with the AWS IoT Gateway. For more information
 * about AWS IoT service, please refer to the <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html"
 * >AWS IoT developer guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use the client directly, a typical flow would be like the below, and since
 * methods in this class are thread-safe, publish and subscribe can be called
 * from different threads.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     AWSIotMqttClient client = new AWSIotMqttClient(...);
 *     
 *     client.connect();
 *     
 *     ...
 *     client.subscribe(topic, ...)
 *     ...
 *     client.publish(message, ...)
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When using this client in conjunction with {@link AWSIotDevice}, one can
 * implement a device that is always synchronized with its AWS IoT shadow by
 * just providing getter and setter methods for the device attributes. The
 * library does all the heavy lifting by collecting device attributes using the
 * getter methods provided and reporting to the shadow periodically. It also
 * subscribes to device changes and updates the device by calling provided
 * setter methods whenever a change is received. All of these are handled by the
 * library with no extra code required from the user. {@link AWSIotDevice} also
 * provides methods for accessing device shadows directly. Please refer to
 * {@link AWSIotDevice} for more details. A typical flow would be like below.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     AWSIotMqttClient client = new AWSIotMqttClient(...);
 *     
 *     SomeDevice someDevice = new SomeDevice(thingName);    // SomeDevice extends AWSIotDevice
 *     
 *     client.attach(someDevice);
 *     
 *     client.connect();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The library contains sample applications that demonstrate different ways of
 * using this client library.
 * </p>
